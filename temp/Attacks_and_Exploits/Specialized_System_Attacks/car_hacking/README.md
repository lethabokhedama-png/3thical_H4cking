# Car Hacking and Security

Cybersecurity in the automobile industry has become increasingly critical as vehicles are now equipped with a variety of networked components and systems that enhance connectivity, functionality, and comfort. However, this connectivity also introduces significant security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors.

## Key Vulnerabilities
1. **Infotainment Systems**: These systems often provide connectivity to mobile devices, access to the internet, and apps. If not properly secured, they can serve as entry points for attackers to gain more extensive access to a vehicle’s critical functions.

2. **Telematics Systems**: Systems that transmit data like GPS location and vehicle diagnostics can be intercepted or tampered with. An attacker could potentially track a vehicle's movements or falsify diagnostic data.

3. **Electronic Control Units (ECUs)**: Modern vehicles can contain dozens of ECUs, which control everything from the engine and brakes to air conditioning. Compromising one ECU can potentially allow an attacker to manipulate critical vehicle functions.

4. **Software Updates**: Over-the-air software updates are convenient for applying the latest updates and patches to vehicles. However, if not properly authenticated, they can be a vector for installing malicious firmware.

5. **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication**: As vehicles begin to communicate with each other to improve safety and traffic efficiency, the risk of intercepting or manipulating these communications grows.

The automotive industry continues to work on these and other cybersecurity elements and to comply with regulatory requirements like ISO/SAE 21434, which focuses on automotive cybersecurity management.
